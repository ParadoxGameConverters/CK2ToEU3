Country mappings are complete for titular duchies and all kingdoms and empires.  There are a ton of non-titular duchies and I don't know what Wiz changed so I left them as is.

Province mappings are complete.

Religion and culture mappings are for use with the CK2 converter mod only, and even there not that useful because I didn't go into the actual converter mod and edit it.  It'll save you from noculture and noreligion, but if you still have Jews being important and not just lumped in with zoroastrians, or you care about the difference between anglo-saxon and anglo-norse I recommend you do some tweaking.  They're included anyway because with them you can still get going and play, though.

Install over the existing converter.  I can't promise I'll keep this updated, but if someone wants to work on a later version's megacampaign feel to use this as a base.
